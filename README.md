## ðŸ§  About TopoDiffuser

**TopoDiffuser** introduces a novel diffusion-based framework for multimodal trajectory prediction that incorporates topometric map guidance. By embedding structural cues from topometric maps into the diffusion process, the model generates diverse, accurate, and road-compliant future trajectories.

Key highlights:

- Leverages LiDAR, historical motion, and OSM-based route priors.
- Uses a conditional diffusion model to handle multimodality.
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark.
